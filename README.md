Just wanted to try out few new things with this TO-DO app. F.ex - MaterialiseCSS, WTFForms and so on.
Did not pay a lot attention to front-end bit, so it wont look perfect. Although hopefully will find some time to add
some JS.

The app includes few simple functions: add/edit/delete task;
User can include progress or mark tasks as important;

Decided not to do registration, as main goal of this project is to test out few small bits.
